You are developing a remote control application for a home automation system.
The system consists of various devices, such as lights, fans, and doors,
which can be controlled remotely.
The remote control should support different commands,
 such as turning on/off devices, adjusting device settings, and executing predefined routines.
 You need to design a flexible and extensible system
 that can handle different commands and execute them on the appropriate devices.

You are developing a music streaming application
that allows users to create playlists and play their favorite songs.
The application needs to provide a way to iterate over the songs in a playlist
so that the user can navigate through the playlist and play the songs sequentially
or in a specific order.
You need to design a mechanism that allows iteration over the songs in a playlist
without exposing the underlying data structure or implementation details.

You are developing a chat application
that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time.
The application supports multiple chat rooms,
and users can join different rooms to participate in group conversations.
You need to design a mechanism that allows users to send messages to other users in the same room
without having direct references to each other,
and also handle the management of chat rooms and user interactions.

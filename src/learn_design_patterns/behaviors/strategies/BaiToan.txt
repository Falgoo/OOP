You are developing a sorting algorithm library that provides different strategies for sorting arrays of integers.
The library should allow clients to choose the sorting strategy dynamically at runtime
based on their specific requirements.
Each sorting strategy should encapsulate a different sorting algorithm,
such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, or Merge Sort. You need to design a mechanism
that allows clients to easily switch between different sorting strategies without modifying the client code.

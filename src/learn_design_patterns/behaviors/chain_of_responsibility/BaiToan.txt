You are developing an order processing system for an e-commerce platform.
The system needs to handle various types of orders,
such as regular orders, expedited orders, and international orders.
Each type of order requires different processing steps,
such as order validation, payment processing, and shipping.
You need to design a flexible and scalable system that can handle different order types
and perform the necessary processing steps in a sequential manner.

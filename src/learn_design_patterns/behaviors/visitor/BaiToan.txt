You are developing a drawing application that allows users to create different shapes,
such as circles, rectangles, and triangles.
The application needs to support various operations on shapes,
such as calculating area, calculating perimeter, and rendering the shapes.
However, you want to add new operations in the future without modifying the shape classes themselves.
You need to design a mechanism that allows new operations to be added dynamically to the shapes without modifying their implementation.

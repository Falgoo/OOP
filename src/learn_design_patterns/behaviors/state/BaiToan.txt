You are developing a vending machine application
that dispenses different products based on user interactions.
The vending machine has different states based on its current state of operation,
such as "Idle", "Product Selected", "Payment Received", and "Product Dispensed".
Each state has different behaviors and transitions.
You need to design a mechanism that allows the vending machine
to change its behavior dynamically based on its current state and handle state transitions seamlessly.

You are developing a weather monitoring application
that needs to notify multiple displays whenever the weather conditions change.
The application should support adding and removing displays dynamically,
and each display should receive updates
whenever there is a change in the weather data.
You need to design a mechanism that allows the displays
to be notified automatically when the weather conditions change
without tightly coupling them to the weather data source.

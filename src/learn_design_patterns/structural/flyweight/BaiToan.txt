You are developing a text editor application
that allows users to format and style text.
The application should be able to handle large amounts of text with various formatting options,
such as font style, size, and color.
However, creating separate objects for each character
or text fragment can consume a significant amount of memory.
You need to optimize the memory usage while still allowing flexible text formatting.
